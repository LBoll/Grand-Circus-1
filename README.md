# Grand-Circus-1
Deliverable 1

Hello! 
I uploaded the file completely from Visual Studios. 
I tried to copy and paste it from there, but when I put it onto GitHub in it's own branch, but it look all funky.
So under ConsoleApp3, and ConsoleApp3 again you should find Program.cs contain the source code for the task of such:

Task: Check if each corresponding place in the two numbers (ones, tens, hundreds, â€¦) sums to the same total.

Input: Your program should read two integer numbers from the user with the same number of digits. 

Output: Your program should print out: True or False based on the result.
